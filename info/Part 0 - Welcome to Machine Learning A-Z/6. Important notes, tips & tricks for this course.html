<p>Dear students,</p><p>We want you to have the best learning experience during the whole journey of this course. Therefore, please find just below some important notes to understand, as well as tips &amp; tricks to take this course in the best conditions:</p><ol><li><p>The practical activities of this course will be done in both Python and R. However,&nbsp;it is absolutely not required to do these practical cases in&nbsp;both programming languages. This course was designed so that people can learn Machine Learning whether they use Python or R in their company,&nbsp;their own business or any specific project. Hence everybody can get comfortable applying Machine Learning on their favorite programming language. But definitely you&nbsp;are not supposed to learn the two. You&nbsp;can do it if you&nbsp;want or if you need it for your work, but usually one of them is sufficient.<br></p></li><li><p>If you wish to learn both programming languages, just be prepared that there are&nbsp;going to be some repetitions. This is normal, the reasons for this is that there are a lot of similarities between Python and R and of course the practical cases solved in this course are the same for these two programming languages. However, just bear in mind that repetitions are not that bad: you will learn a lot of concepts and techniques in this course and the fact that we repeat the same elements from one programming language to another will help these concepts&nbsp;stick better into your head.<br></p></li><li><p>The video lectures of this course were recorded at a certain pace so that everybody can adjust the speed to learn at their&nbsp;own rhythm. To adjust the speed you simply need to click&nbsp;the following "Speed" button at the bottom left corner of the video lecture:</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-01-25_01-08-28-208620d3f687149c1ac5defa025bd840.png"></figure><p>If you find the pace too slow you can increase the speed to 1.25x, 1.5x or even 2x.<br>If you find the pace too fast you can decrease the speed to 0.75x or 0.5x.<br></p></li><li><p>If there is anything unclear or if you have any question during a Lecture, please keep in mind that there is a very high chance another student asked for some clarifications on the exact same element you need. You can easily find the answer to your question by browsing the Q&amp;A of the specific Lecture you are watching. To browse the Q&amp;A&nbsp;of the Lecture you simply need to click "Browse Q&amp;A" at the bottom of the Lecture:<img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-01-25_00-44-42-fa6d22503d2c5989aa7e0c49f1f4d84c.png">Once you click "Browse Q&amp;A" you will see all the questions and answers related to this Lecture on the right side of the screen:<img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-01-25_00-46-32-364e79823e19ff318b1a170ebbddcd1a.png">As you can see the questions have titles so you will easily find the same question you are wondering about. If you don't find your question you can of course ask a new question in the Q&amp;A of the&nbsp;Lecture you are in.</p></li></ol><p>We will add more tips &amp; tricks based on our&nbsp;observations of students feedbacks. In the meantime we&nbsp;wish you the best learning experience.</p><p>Enjoy Machine Learning!</p><p>Kirill &amp; Hadelin</p>
