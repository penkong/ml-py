<p>Hi Students!</p><p><strong>Did you know that by participating in the Q&amp;A it can help:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Make connections with peers within the domain</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Reinforce course information</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Gain useful insight related to course content</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Lead to more course content completed</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Improve and obtain better results from specific models</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Have your model or customization featured in the course</strong></p></li></ul><p>One main way to help become a better Data Scientist is by joining the discussions. For this, we want to mention the importance of our <strong>community of students</strong> here. We continuously see and have had students post helpful information, impressive updates and customizations to algorithms that improved results, and have witnessed connections continuously being made in the Q&amp;A.</p><p><strong>We have even featured some students' contributions in the course itself! Imagine being able to mention in an interview, or with an employer that your model was featured in a top course in the Data Science or Artificial Intelligence domain?</strong></p><p>This leads us to our main point of adding this which is to help emphasize the importance of self learning for this domain. We can easily show you the benefits of helping others (for those of you who are interested, please see here: <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/71964/7-scientific-benefits-helping-others" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/71964/7-scientific-benefits-helping-others</a> but, in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and any software or programming related career, it will be a required and critical skill to be able to search and solve problems as they develop. This can include any type of common bugs from programs or issues that may pop up due. As libraries, languages and IDE’s are consistently updated, you may run into a bug every so often. This is just part of the nature of the domain that we are in.</p><p><strong>Due to this, we want to highlight the importance of self learning and accessing resources such as Google, StackOverflow (or any of the related StackExchanges), or even discussing questions amongst your fellow peers, is a phenomenal way to learn. For those of you who work in the domain, running into problems and solving them is a core method of learning. Personally, answering and debugging questions in the course has helped me become a better AI Engineer/Data Scientist and developer overall.</strong></p><p>In addition, if you would like to practice the information from the course, reinforce concepts, and discuss ideas, discussing and answering questions of your peers is another important method to help learn. This can lead to making connections, study groups and habits, and overall improving your course experience by assisting others. Research has also shown that collaboration and participation can lead to increased completion of the material in the course.</p><p>To recap, participating in the Q&amp;A in the course can help you with:</p><ul><li><p>Form study habits</p></li><li><p>Reinforce course information and gain useful insight</p></li><li><p>Make connections with peers</p></li><li><p>Improve your overall course learning experience</p></li><li><p>Altruism</p></li><li><p>Purpose</p></li></ul><p>*While participating in the Q&amp;A please abide by Udemy’s Terms and Conditions, and be courteous to all participants. We are all on different stages of learning in the course, and every question is a great opportunity to learn!</p><p><strong>We greatly appreciate all of the feedback we continuously receive and keep up the awesome work!</strong></p>
