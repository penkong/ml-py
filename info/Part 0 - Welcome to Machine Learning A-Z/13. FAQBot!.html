<p><strong>Hello Students!</strong></p><p><strong>As an additional resource, we are working on deploying our FAQBot (Mango) to help answer any frequently asked - FAQ related questions for the course. You will see Mango (our bot) in the Q&amp;A to help provide access to FAQ based questions and information quickly.</strong></p><p><strong>If you have a chance, please feel free test it out using the link mentioned below as we continue training and testing. To be clear, this bot is in early-stage development. Please be aware of any inaccuracy or error while we continue to improve it.</strong></p><p><strong>*Mango is still undergoing training, testing, and revisions.</strong></p><p>Hi everyone and welcome to our new chatbot! We are hoping to use this chatbot to help answer some of your questions related to the course, or any general course related information to help continue learning. When interacting with the chatbot, please remember that this is a model in training and we expect to have quite a few iterations, development and testing phases to help it learn. Also, please be as clear as possible when asking questions with Mango.</p><p><strong>You can ask questions such as:</strong></p><ul><li><p>How to create an anaconda environment?</p></li><li><p>Where can I find the AI Handbook?</p></li><li><p>What is the dummy variable trap?</p></li><li><p>How to get information on the certificate of completion?</p></li><li><p>What is the best choice for a data science programming language?</p></li><li><p>How to choose the number of hidden layers?</p></li><li><p>Can you explain regression?</p></li><li><p>Where can I get the files for Machine Learning?</p></li><li><p>How to get the files for Deep Learning?</p></li></ul><p><strong>But please feel free to ask other course related questions so that Mango can learn. *Please keep them course related.</strong></p><p><strong>In addition, some other great resources for further information or assistance to help debug any error include the recommended readings, </strong><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>http://stackoverflow.com/</strong></a><strong>, and </strong><a href="https://datascience.stackexchange.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>https://datascience.stackexchange.com/</strong></a><strong>. Our TAâ€™s will do their best to help answer any questions but as DS/ML/AI engineers, becoming comfortable debugging, searching resources and documentation online will become a critical skill for success.</strong></p><p>Lastly, please be aware of any errors, or unexpected outcomes. As Data Scientists we consistently need to test, develop and improve our models. We also want to thank you for helping to test our bot, and we hope it helps answer any questions that you might have!</p><p>To test Mango directly:</p><p><strong>Mango:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/welcome-to-faqbot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/welcome-to-faqbot</a></p>
