<p>Hello my friends,</p><p>Please find below the link to the folder containing all the Python codes, R codes, and datasets of this course:</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OFNnrHRZPZ3unWdErjLHod8Ibv2FfG1d?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OFNnrHRZPZ3unWdErjLHod8Ibv2FfG1d?usp=sharing</a></p><p>This folder contains the Python files in .ipynb format, which is the format used to code in Python on Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory.</p><p><strong>Important Note 1:</strong> Please download this folder on your machine in order to get all the files, especially the datasets which we will have to upload when training the Machine Learning models. In the practical tutorials you will be guided step by step on how to navigate this folder and start coding in Python &amp; R.</p><p><strong>Important Note 2 (Python coders only):</strong> In order to open the Python files of this folder with Google Colaboratory, you need to have a Gmail account and sign in to that account. This will automatically open this folder on your Google Drive, which will indeed allow you to open the Python files with Google Colaboratory. Then once you open the file, it will be in read-only mode, so in order to code inside you just have to go to File, and then click "Save a copy in Drive...". This will create a copy of this file on your drive, inside which you will be able to code in Python.</p><p><strong>Important Note 3 (Python coders only):</strong> If you don't want to code on Google Colaboratory and prefer to code on another Python IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Spyder in Anaconda, you can find all the .ipynb files and the .py files in the folder attached at the bottom of this article.</p><p>I can't wait to see you in the practical lectures.</p><p>Until then, enjoy Machine Learning!</p><p>Hadelin</p>
